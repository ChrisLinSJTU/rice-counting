# rice-counting
This is a rice counting algorithm. 
First, run the get_average_area.m script to get the average area of each rice grains. To simplify the image preprocessing, some of the Non-target object in the image have been artificially removed.The image is showed below.

Second, run the get_avg_fre_without_overlap.m to get the average frequency of the sequence of rice grains without overlap.

Finally, run the cal_number_of_rice.m to caltulation the number of rice in the image we provided.
